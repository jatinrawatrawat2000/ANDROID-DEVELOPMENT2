# ANDROID-DEVELOPMENT2
The project to develop the above repository for Android was carried out by myself and my additional member as a part of the VTU Mini Project for Mobile Application Development.
Â A QUIZ AND A YOGA APP USING JAVA AND JSON FILES ARE CONTAINED IN THE ABOVE REPOSITORY.The quiz app uses a static database to guess answers, while the yoga app mostly makes use of Android Studio's basic views.
